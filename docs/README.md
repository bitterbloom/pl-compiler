## Overview

The documents in `overview` are meant to cover all language features without going into too much detail.
They assume a fair bit of knowledge about programming languages and language concepts.
They are meant to be a quick reference and can be read in any order.

## **TODO** The sections to be written:

- [ ] Variables (include move semantics, mutability, etc.)
- [x] [Functions](overview/functions_and_methods.md#Functions)
- [x] [Methods](overview/functions_and_methods.md#Methods)
- [ ] Control flow (include `for` macros)
- [x] [Structs](overview/structs.md)
- [x] [Enums](overview/enums_and_unions.md#Enums)
- [x] [Unions](overview/enums_and_unions.md#Unions)
- [ ] Type aliases (include `as` keyword)
- [ ] Reference types
- [x] [Generics](overview/generics)
- [ ] Traits (include foreign defaults, auto traits, hide keyword)
- [ ] Auto traits (include `Sized(S: UInt)`)
- [ ] Operators overloading
- [ ] Type inference
- [ ] Modules (include generics)
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Allocators
- [ ] Undefined behavior (include address aliasing, uninitialized memory, etc.)
- [ ] Interop
- [ ] Macros
- [ ] Contexts
- [ ] Anonymous types (include structally typed types, generative types with `newtype`)
- [ ] Opaque types
